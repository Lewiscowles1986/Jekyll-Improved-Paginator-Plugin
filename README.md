# Jekyll-Improved-Paginator-Plugin
Jekyll's built-in paginator sucks! You are forced to use index.html for reasons I don't understand, and you have to work-around with what I feel is too much restriction, so this repo contains a plugin that fixes that, or attempts to. You can list a specific collection, or all posts, and pagination works seamlessly supporting some edge use-cases I felt the paginator did not address
